Regression Workshop - StackOverflow 2021 Developer Salary Prediction Model

* Data from the 2021 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey - https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey
* Interactive web app using streamlit to predict Developer salaries based on input criteria of country, education level, and years of coding experience..<br>
* The Jupyter notebook includes the data preprocessing and cleaning process as well as an evaluation and grid search of Regression algorithms.<br>
* The model with the best score-to-resource consumption ended up being a Decision Tree Regressor with max_depth = 10. Linear regression, polynomial regression, L1 Lasso, L2 Ridge, and Random Forest regressors were all evaluated but Decision Tree ended up being the most suitable choice.<br>
